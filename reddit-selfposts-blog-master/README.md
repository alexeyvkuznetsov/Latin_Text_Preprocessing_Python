Starting from https://evolution.ai//blog/page/5/an-imagenet-like-text-classification-task-based-on-reddit-posts/ we take the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/mswarbrickjones/reddit-selfposts and perform modern text analytics.

There is a corresponding blog series on [Medium](https://medium.com/@datanizing/modern-text-mining-with-python-part-1-of-5-introduction-cleaning-and-linguistics-647f9ec85b6a).
